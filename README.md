# iperf3-server-docker (DEPRECATED)
### Succeeded by simpler image [RouterZero/iperf-server](https://github.com/RouterZero/iperf-server)
 
Containerized iperf3 running as a server.

Iperf 3 removes environment variables support, therefore making it less friendly for containerization. 

This image partially restores env. variables support.
